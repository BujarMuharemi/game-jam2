## To Do List
### General
* find a name for the game
* get your game play tested by 5 people or more

### Most important for today *(23.2)*
* test the game design of the xray view -> works good
    * test change xray time to just work when player holds button down, and he has like 2/3 seconds to use, after its depleted it take 3 seconds to recharge, but only when fully recharged its usable (grey while recharging)
* draw "ball player" 
* ~~and just 1 health, because it makes everything worse~~ â†’ instant death makes it better
* add parallax effect to game so it has depth
* "level done" pickup w/ icon and  next lvl canvas(without function)
* shader w/ radius for x ray
* add some pickup for points/ u have to pick up all to pass a level...

### Art 
- import all art without cutting the corners to hard
- different backgrounds (tree layer, mountains/hills etc)
- draw hearts for UI
- draw icon/bar for xray view

#### *later*
* particle effects for everything
* post processing ?
* light at pickups ?

### Level Design 
Levels design and creation of the 3 levels should be done after all the art and game mechanics are almost final. 

* tutorial level
* checkpoints
* first easy level
* second/end level
* 5 min playtime for the whole game ?
* level loading mechanism

### UI 
* show xray view somehow
* next level/level completed canvas
* death counter ?
* starting menu etc
### SFX 
should also be done before starting level creation. I very simple in unity.
* player "rolling/walking", jumping, landing, getting hit, dying
* canon shooting, bullet hitting
* chainsaw working
* pushing boxes
* using xray effect

### Music
* some chill music which matches the style and pace of the game
* 2 songs minimum, which loop
